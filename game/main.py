"""""
Careful:
 I used numpy to store the position of every block. Although, axis 1 in numpy arrays is the y axis, axis 2 is the x axis
 The numpy array that stores the position of the blocks is called grid, there can be 3 different values:
    0 is when there's no block
    1 is for the blocks that you can move
    2-8 is for the bdlocks that you can't move anymore, the number depends on the color
